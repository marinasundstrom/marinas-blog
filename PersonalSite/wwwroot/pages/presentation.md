I have been doing programming since 2007. Ever since, in my career and in my free time, I have been learning a lot about software engineering and all the different aspects involved in building software, not just the technical but also the organizational side.

I have mainly worked with C#/.NET, but also Web development using JavaScript and frameworks like React.

I am a positive person who is enthusiastic about life and experiencing the world. I enjoy meeting new people everywhere. I am easy-going, thoughtful, and reflecting on whatever crosses my mind. I am goal-oriented but also find the journey exciting. I like to get into the details to get that deeper understanding of the subject at hand. You could say that I am a geek.


My career kicked off in 2014, when I was brought on a project [building an app for emergency response services](/blog/building-software-for-emergency-response). That later landed me a position as System developer. Since then I have worked both as a full-time employee and as a consultant for various companies in industries such as medical equipment, physical security, food processing, and housing.


Software design is one of my areas of interest. I also care about User Experience (UX). I believe that is important to focus on Use Cases when building great software that users value.

As a full stack developer, I take a holistic perspective on software development. My motivation is in understanding the purpose of what I am doing and how it helps people. What I contribute with is my skills, insights, and knowledge from previous business domains and places that I have worked in.

My competence lies mainly in development on the .NET platform - from building desktop apps and developing services as part of bigger systems. I have also been doing Web development in a number of projects that used JavaScript/TypeScript and React. Besides that, I have also used and explored a number of other technologies. I am eager to learn new things

I thrive in an environment in which there is commitment and motivation to the task at hand, as well as openness to new ideas and perspectives. I do believe that it is important for everyone to feel included and to be heard.

I like spending time working on [my own projects](/portfolio), from which I learn a lot about the ins and outs of building software, concerning both the technical side and User Experience (UX). I enjoy working from use cases and researching the domains. Thinking about how I could improve something. As a creative person, I find the activity itself stimulating and fun. 

I am also active in the software development community on the Internet, where I participate in the discussions, and share knowledge with others.

## Me, beyond that

I am a picky coffee lover who likes to grind their own beans.

Since way back, I enjoy listening to foreign music, learning the languages and cultures. I also travel when I get the opportunity. My main interest has been the Spanish, Italian, and Hindi/Urdu cultural spheres. I easily pick up the basics of languages. So when I meet native-speakers they often get surprised about how much I know about their cultures.

Now and then, I go out in the country-side to spend some time with my family. I have two wonderful nieces, and a nephew whom I all love so much.

I enjoy taking walks in beautiful nature, whether I have someone's company or I am alone. When I am on my own it is the time for me to reflect, to clear and focus my mind and energy. 

During my last vacation, I got into making cocktails from being inspired by videos. Since then I have made and enjoyed a number of Sours and other kinds of drinks - also making them for others. 

My favorite cocktail at the moment is [Margarita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarita). I enjoy it with two slices of Jalapeño which give it a spicy edge. Now and then, I also enjoy a classic ["Old Fashioned"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_fashioned_(cocktail)).
