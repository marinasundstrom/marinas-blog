My first real job as a Software Developer was back in early 2014 to 2016 for a small-sized company that sold electronics, provided IT-services, as well as being an Internet Service Provider (ISP) - providing broadband and fiber to customers. My first assignment was [building an app for emergency response](/articles/building-software-for-emergency-response) from ground up. It was the best time ever. I worked closely with the product owner who had all the technical knowledge, testing skills, and more. He really left an impression on me. I really showed off my skills, learning a lot more in the process.

I later joined the development department and became a part of the team there. We were working on a all kinds of system integrations that were used internally. I'm talking about Web portals and services - microservices before that was a thing. We worked on a system for handling broadband & fiber subscriptions and provisioning. There was also an IT incident system for the business area using that. We collaborated closely with the people that were using what we built. I admit that it was not easy adjusting at first. But the guys in the team and I became friends and hung out outside work. It was not without dramas and so, but we stuck together. We knew each others strengths and weaknesses.

About 2 years into my time there a new boss entered and my worst period started. He wanted to transform the development apartment, and I was one of the people who he felt was unpredictable. He had demanded full control and chaos ensued. I found this new boss intimidating, and I was not the only one who thought so. He divided the original team and made the environment much less safe. I felt constantly judged by him. Sure. I did mistakes due to the stress and anxiety - the lack of support. It all made me doubt myself, and whether I should work as a Software Developer.

Approximately 8 months later, my employment ended when the boss put me on notice for “labor shortages”. In other words, there was no place for me in his plan and he had found a way to get rid of me. It was chock to me, but team mates stood up for me. “What are you doing? You are firing our best developer.” (I have been told by the person who said that) They were unsuccessful in changing the verdict. It was a quick process. My colleagues, my friends, ensured me that it was not my fault. I was sad since I had to leave this environment in which I until then had felt safe in. Suddenly leaving everyone that I had come to know was hard. This event has left a mark on my confidence that echoes still today.

A couple of years later I heard that the boss had got rid of another person from the team after I left: the young woman responsible for UX and Web Development. I also heard from other people in the consultancy business that the boss was not liked at the place from where he came before joining the company. And later, an old colleague from the company told me that it did not work out for the boss and that he instead had left for a customer.

Anyway, after leaving the company, I went on a one week long trip to New York City together with one of my friends and his family. It was such an exciting experience. I'm thankful for that opportunity to explore that city for a second time (Yes, had been there once before). And my worries were suppressed during my time there.

After coming back from the trip, I quickly got an employment as a consultant in Software Development. 

The rest is a story for another time!
