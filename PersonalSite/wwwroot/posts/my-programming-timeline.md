Here are some highlights from my programming career. I've done so much more but I think that this is worth mentioning. 

_Thanks to [Aryan Rahman](https://aryanrahman3212.netlify.app/blog/27_1_2023_timeline) who did his own timeline and inspired me to do my own._

* **~2003** - Got exposed to VBScript. Started building simple scripts with alerts and prompts.

* **2006** - Got introduced to C# by a guy who worked at Microsoft. (*My teacher's son)

* **2007** - Walked through the book "Visual C# 2015 Step by Step" in the summer. Back at school, I did a test and skipped my A course in Programming.

* **2008 - 2009** - Built a compiler for a school project. Learning parsing and advanced problem-solving. The language was based on C and C# so I called it "C micro". The compiler was built in C#.

* **2011** - Built a Visual Basic.NET compiler in C#. Its architecture and design was based on the Mono VB.NET compiler. Even added improvements to error handling.

* **2014** - Started working for a company where I built a messenger-like desktop app for emergency response (police, ambulance, firefighters). It interfaced with custom hardware. The technology used was C#/.NET and WPF with the MVVM pattern. Then I built another tool for programming the hardware.

* **2015 - 2016** - Worked as a System developer in a team developing internal system integrations for handling incidents and managing customers for broadband & fiber provisioning. The company acted as an Internet Service Provider (ISP). Projects built for Web with PHP, NodeJS, and C#.

* **2015** - Built a website for tracking thunder and lightning with some friends. It included a custom-made map displaying live data from Blitzortung. It was built for Web with NodeJS for backend.

* **2017** - Built a music player mobile app for an Axis speaker, as a side-project. Ran on iOS and Android. Built with C#/.NET and Xamarin.Forms.

* **2017 - 2018** - Build my own Access Control system on Raspberry Pi. Service-oriented architecture. C#/.NET. Web and Blazor. Mobile apps in Xamarin.Forms.

* **2018** - Built a site for presenting consultant, as a side-project when waiting for assignment. I learned about organizing code by features and to focus on use cases. The app was branded. It was built with C#/.NET ASP.NET Core and Blazor. Used MediatR.

* **2019** - Working as a consultant on solution for the Processing and Packaging industry. Helped refactoring and upgrading a big monolithic codebase. Built in C#/.NET Framework.

* **2019** - Built my own mobile app for keeping track of bus and train departures while commuting. Styled it to look like the timetables. Used public Web APIs. Built with C#/.NET and Xamarin.Forms.

* **2020 - 2021** - Worked for a company where I developed an entire ERP system (CRM, Ordering, Invoicing etc) with e-commerce abilities. Dealing with a monolithic architecture. Implemented integration with BankId. Built customer sites. Customers were an insurance company and a cleaning company. The system was built in C#/.NET ASP.NET Core and Blazor. Used Wordpress as CMS. Explored a lot of technology on options of the side.

* **2021** - Getting into Software Design and Architecture patterns. Explored Monoliths and Microservices, and what Event-driven architecture is about. Worked on various pet projects: Product Catalog, TimeReport, and continued on Showroom. How to integrate the various projects. Resulting in "[YourBrand](https://github.com/marinasundstrom/YourBrand)".

* **2022** - Dove into Domain-driven design (DDD) practices. Further exploring Software Design and Architecture patterns. Refined the projects that I had built previously, and integrated them into one business case and domain. Ending up with "[eShop](https://github.com/marinasundstrom/eShop)".
