As a consultant, I have been in multiple teams that have been using a project methodology based on _Scrum_ - call it "Scrum-ish". I have even tasted the _Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)_ in one place.


## Caught in processes 

Processes that most of the time and energy/.

## Communication challenges

Bubbles

Members in their own bubbles focusing on their small part - apparent now in remote work

## No common goals

Lack of clear common goals and commitment -
No product-focus

## No team empowerment

Teams are not empowered to make their own decisions. Being responsible.

## Conclusion

Less is more

Having worked as a sole developer working for a company.


What you need in a team is:

* Empowerment and involvement

* A set of clear common goals
* Somewhere to track your work
* Good communication between members
