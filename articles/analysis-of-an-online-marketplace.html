<hr>
<p>During my short tenure at <a href="https:///www.cdon.com/">CDON</a>, a Swedish online marketplace, I got experience with the site and how consumers might view both the site and brand. These are my observations of and thoughts about the product: the CDON Marketplace.</p>
<section id="background">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The purpose with this article is analyzing the CDON Marketplace and to highlight what I believe could be improved from a consumers perspective with regards to consumer merchant awareness.</p>
<p>Although I have been an employee at CDON, as a Software developer, the opinions stated in this article are purely my own. They are based on personal experience with the site.</p>
<p>I very much enjoyed writing this article.</p>
</section>
<section id="scope">
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>I will introduce the CDON Marketplace, give a general idea of how products are being listed. I will address how the lack of merchant awareness among consumers caused issues for them. In the process, I might refer to some past events to give context to the subject.</p>
<p>This article does not deal with any technical details - just the user/consumer experience.</p>
<p><em>This was written about the state of the site as of 2022 - in fact written in early 2023. Depending on when you read this, details might have changed and this article might have been outdated.</em></p>
</section>
<section id="company-background-cdon">
<h2>Company background: CDON</h2>
<p>CDON is an online marketplace with thousands of merchants putting their product offers on display, but it did not start out that way. It has been continuously growing by adding new merchants and their product offers to their catalog. They are now (2023) about 2500 active merchants and over 12 million products, according to interview linked below.</p>
<p>Back when the company was established around the year 2000, they used to be the sole merchant on their site - mainly selling CDs, DVDs, and Video games. They were themselves responsible for everything as they held the goods and earned the money. That gave confidence to consumers and that is what built the "CDON" brand.</p>
</section>
<section id="challenges-going-from-retailer-to-marketplace">
<h2>Challenges going from retailer to marketplace</h2>
<p>Going from being a reputable retailer to becoming a marketplace has not been easy for CDON. People working for the company have admitted that to me. Just look it from the perspective of a consumer. I remember a couple of years ago when I, as a consumer, visited the site for the first time in a long while. I first got surprised that ”vidaXL” was the one selling the product that I viewed on CDON. I was used to CDON being the one selling stuff on their site. So I can understand how other people feel when they notice that.</p>
<p>But some people might not be that attentive and simply expects to purchase something safely. The CDON brand is what gives them that confidence.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-the-cdon-marketplace-works">
<h2>How the CDON Marketplace works</h2>
<p>The CDON Marketplace is an online marketplace site that helps consumers compare product offers (called “Deals”). This means that for every listed product there might be multiple offers by different merchants. But consumers will, by default, see the product offer with a bargain price. Thus, the focus is not on the merchant but the product. The consumer can then purchase the selected product(s) from the site while CDON mediates the order to the merchant. It is then treated as a direct sale with the merchant being responsible to fullfil the order.</p>
<p>The online marketplace model has become popular with consumers because they can find a wide range of products and compare different offers in one place. And it gives exposure to especially smaller merchants and their products.</p>
<p>Marketplaces are themselves brands that do not necessarily want to put too much highlight on the individual merchant's own brand. Otherwise the consumer would go to the merchant's own site and buy from there instead. Many online marketplaces look up to Amazon as the leading model. They are seemingly strong without clearly showing individual merchant brands.</p>
<p>But Amazon do in fact have some merchant brand recognition for stores. For example: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/DD4A66B7-C19D-4F05-BE32-2FC7C733D470?ingress=0&amp;visitId=a814d660-4a53-4b96-8bf1-32a4fd8c8b7f">Zappos at Amazon</a>. There are things to criticize there since it is quite convoluted.</p>
</section>
<section id="responsibilities-of-a-marketplace">
<h2>Responsibilities of a marketplace</h2>
<p>The CDON <a href="https://help.cdon.com/hc/sv/articles/360026395371">Terms of Service (TOS)</a> (Swedish) states that CDON only acts as a mediator for a transaction between consumer and merchant. Once an order is placed the merchant is responsible for the sale and delivery (unless CDON is the merchant).</p>
<p>In October 2022, due to a merchant going bankrupt there was public pressure on CDON to take responsibility and to compensate their customers for outstanding deliveries. That led CDON to take the “moral responsibility” helping all customers of their failed merchant getting their money back regardless of payment method - despite not having legal responsibility to do so. (<a href="https://www.breakit.se/artikel/35207/cdon-kunder-far-pengarna-tillbaka-till-slut-vi-gor-mer-an-lagen-kraver">Interview with CEO</a>)</p>
<p>This event clearly shows how consumers still view CDON.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-did-they-end-up-like-this">
<h2>How did they end up like this?</h2>
<p>So why did focusing on their own brand not work for the CDON?</p>
<p>Simply because of the legacy as being a reputable merchant themselves, and failing to communicate their new direction to consumers. As an online marketplace acting as a middle-man it is important to be clear about what you are, what you are not, and what your responsibilities are.</p>
<p>Merchant brand recognition makes the consumer aware of who is actually responsible for fulfilling the sale - namely, the merchant.</p>
<p>I think that the problems could have been avoided with a bit of self-knowledge and putting oneself in the consumer's shoes.</p>
</section>
<section id="proposing-improvements">
<h2>Proposing improvements</h2>
<p>So what could at least have be improved with the site?</p>
<p>First of all, the problem was that consumers did not understand that they were purchasing from the Merchant - not from CDON. On the site, the only indication was a “small” text "This product is sold by &lt;merchant&gt;” under the "Add to cart" button. There was no merchant logo or so.</p>
<p>In the spirit of wanting to improve stuff, I actually built a Chrome browser extension that added the merchant logos to Product Offer pages as well as Merchant Pages. The aim was to show others at the company how it would look, and hopefully convince them to introduce the change.</p>
<p>In addition, I think that introducing individual "Merchant Stores" that distinguish the merchants would be a good idea.</p>
<section id="why-would-they-not-implement-this">
<h3>Why would they not implement this?</h3>
<p>Well, why have they not already considered doing this? Simply, CDON wants merchants to ride on their brand, just like Amazon does. Adding the logos of merchant companies would arguably serve their brands rather than CDON.</p>
<p>But you might as well argue that CDON is hosting some big companies as merchants, so it could bite back on them even more if one of them would fail and the responsibilities still are unclear to consumers.</p>
<p>It is still (as of January 2023) not too late to adopt these changes. It all depends on the new leadership. Although, I doubt they will do it for the coming "CDON 2.0" release.</p>

<section id="final-words">
<h2>Final words</h2>
<p>There are opportunities to improve beyond that of competing online marketplaces - mainly by increasing consumer merchant awareness through merchant brand recognition.</p>
