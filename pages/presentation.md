I've been programming since 2007, continuously learning and expanding my expertise in software engineering—both technically and organizationally. Throughout my career and personal projects, I've explored various aspects of building software beyond just writing code.

My primary expertise lies in C#/.NET, but I also have experience in web development using JavaScript and frameworks like React.

### This is me
I'm a positive, curious, and thoughtful individual who enjoys experiencing life and meeting new people. I'm easy-going yet reflective, always eager to dive deep into topics that intrigue me. You could say I'm a geek at heart—I love understanding the finer details and how things work.

I thrive in environments where commitment, motivation, and openness to new ideas are valued. I strongly believe in fostering inclusivity and ensuring that every voice is heard.

### Career Journey
My professional journey took off in 2014 when I joined a project [developing an app for emergency response services](/articles/building-software-for-emergency-response). This opportunity led to my first role as a System Developer. Since then, I've worked both as a full-time employee and a consultant across various industries, including medical equipment, physical security, food processing, and housing.

My expertise is primarily in .NET development, from creating desktop applications to developing services within larger systems. I've also worked on numerous web development projects using JavaScript, TypeScript, and React. Beyond these, I've explored various technologies and continuously seek new learning opportunities.

### Passion for Software Development
I love working on [personal projects](/portfolio) that allow me to refine my skills and experiment with different technologies. Whether focusing on technical implementation or enhancing user experience (UX), I find the creative process both stimulating and rewarding.

I'm also an active participant in the online software development community, engaging in discussions and sharing knowledge with others.

### Coffee & Nature
I'm a picky coffee lover who grinds my own beans. When I’m not coding, I enjoy long walks in beautiful nature—either alone for reflection or with good company.

### Languages & Travel
I've long been fascinated by foreign music, languages, and cultures, particularly those from Spanish, Italian, and Hindi/Urdu-speaking regions. I enjoy learning new languages and surprising native speakers with my knowledge of their culture. Whenever possible, I love to travel and immerse myself in different cultural experiences.

### Cooking & Cocktails
Cooking is another creative outlet of mine. I take inspiration from Italian cuisine, Creole flavors, and Asian dishes—like Korean barbecue. Each time I cook, I refine my skills through intuition and experimentation, always seeking new flavor combinations.

Inspired by mixology videos, I also enjoy crafting cocktails, especially [sour cocktails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sour_(cocktail)). My go-to drink is a classic [Margarita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarita) with two slices of jalapeño for an extra kick, though I also appreciate a well-made [Old Fashioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_fashioned_(cocktail)).

### Family Time
When I get the chance, I retreat to the countryside to spend time with my family, including my two wonderful nieces and my nephew, whom I adore.
