I'm a Software engineer who is based in [MalmÃ¶, Sweden](https://www.google.se/maps/place/MalmÃ¶/@55.5702455,12.9457618,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x465305a574c491ff:0xd3a905dfbd4888e5!8m2!3d55.604981!4d13.003822?hl=en).

I have been doing programming since 2007. Ever since, in my career and in my free time, I have been learning a lot about software engineering and all the different aspects involved in building software, not just the technical but also the organizational side.

I have mainly worked with C#/.NET, but also Web development using JavaScript and frameworks like React.

Some of my interests are taking walks in beautiful nature, philosophizing while enjoying a good cup of coffee, and making tasty cocktails.

Here is a more extensive [presentation](/presentation) of myself.
