## What is Antisemitism?

Antisemitism is any hate or prejudice directed at Jews for being Jewish. An ancient form of prejudice.

This article might be centered around the Jews of Europe, the Ashkenazim, but the pattern repeats itself elsewhere, even in the Middle East.

### Jews as "the foreigners"

Historically, Jews have been seen as "the others", foreigners, that don't belong to the country they reside. Leading them to be seen as a foreign threat. Jews have been used as a scapegoat whenever there has been an internal divide or conflict between the "natives". If there was a conflict, the Jews were said to be to blame for it.

Due to the persecution, Jews have throughout history largely kept their interactions with other people at a minimum. That has contributed to them being less open and therefore the lack of understanding about Judaism.

Even in the Middle-East this was a thing, although the Jewish presence, in for instance Arabia, predates Islam, and the Arab conquest. The Jews from that area can be seen as native there.

### "Jews are greedy"

Due to them historically being barred from owning property, being limited to being tradesmen and lending money, they got the reputation of being greedy. The fact is that no other people was allowed to handle money because of Christian doctrine about usury. And because of this it instilled in Jews, at least in Europe, a good sense of saving and investing money.

### Misunderstandings about the "Chosen people"

By Anti-semites, the claim that Jews are the "Chosen people" is often used as some kind of claim for Jewish supremacy. 

Jews being the "Chosen people" is about the covenant and the ethical mission from God, and not about any preference by God. It's not that they think they are better than others, in particular non-Jews.

Jewish religious tradition is an ethical framework that is not based on blind faith, but on intention, with the Torah is the book guiding you. The basis is universal, and for all mankind (the Noahide Laws), but Jews have some special commandment to follow.

It doesn't rule out that other people have different covenants with God, and therefore are chosen for other reasons. And even Jews are clear about that.

However, the "Chosen people" has been willfully misconstrued by opponents because of the situation between Israel and Palestine. "How can you be the 'Chosen people' when attacking the Palestinians".

### "Jews are controlling the world"

The allegation that Jews control the world seems to stem from a pamphlet that was spread in 1905, called the “Protocols of the Elders of Zion”, originating in Russia. It was written as some kind of acknowledgment by "Zionists" ("Jews") that they were controlling and taking over the world from behind the scenes. Having supposedly infiltrated liberal, capitalist, communist, and free masonic elites. Since then this has been a common antisemitic conspiracy theory.

It has been shown that the Tazist Secret Services (of Russia) was behind the spreading of the pamphlet, and even claimed it to be an address delivered at the World Zionist Congress in Basel 1897, by Theodor Herzl, the leading person of the Zionist movement aiming to establish a Jewish homeland.

This further led to establishing "Zionist" as a slur referring to Jew, which carried over to the Soviet Union.

### "Jews murdered Jesus"

This one might not be as prevalent in the largely secular "Old World" (Europe):

It has historically been portrayed, by Christians, that Jews collectively had turned on Jesus - and effectively killed him. To further establish the notion of betrayal and otherness - to divorce Christianity from Judaism. But Jesus was a Jew. The Bible says, it was the Romans that sentenced and murdered Jesus because he was seen as a threat.

Whether the events happened, or not, we can discuss another tiem.

Christian antisemitism is a thing. A leftover from when Christianity tried to replace Judaism. That requires more history, but we leave that here.

## What is Anti-Zionism?

### What is a Zionist?

As alluded to above, the term "Zionist" as many anti-semites use it today was coined in Russia as a slur for Jew - to mark them as a threat to the country. That was before Israel even existed. It carried little connection to Zionism - more than it connected Jews to "Zionist". It was a way to dehumanize and marginalize Jews as a separate group with their own political motives - when most just wanted to be treated as equals.

This coincided with the "Emancipation" when, over the course of more than a century, Jews in Europe slowly were granted rights and citizenship in the new order of nation states, at the collapse of empires.

This was in Soviet where they tried to break down ethnic and class divisions, and yet antisemitism still existed there. Despite that, many Jews in the Soviet were socialists but had a different understanding of it that was a threat to the regime.  People were thinking that Jews sought power.

### Contemporary "Anti-Zionism"

Today, Anti-zionism, antisemitism disguised as a legitimate dislike or hate for Israel. Often they refer to the Israel-Palestine conflict, and how Israel supposedly treat Palestinians. While Palestinians themselves have a very bad track record.

Anti-zionism is often used as an excuse to attack Jews for being Jewish. Especially from the anti-colonialist leftist and the Muslim side.

## When do they coincide?

When someone is calling a Jews a small, dirty, and nasty "Zionist" you are immediately evokes antisemitic tropes. And when they accuse a Jews of being without empathy. Or when they mean that Zionist control the world.

If they only accept a Jew being a Zionist and gentiles being useful idiots.

Read between the lines, and discover the historic antisemitic tropes till being spread, but re-packaged to not be as apparent.
