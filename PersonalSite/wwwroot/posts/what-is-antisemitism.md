## What is Antisemitism?

Antisemitism is any hate or prejudice directed at Jews for being Jewish. An ancient form of prejudice.

This article might be centered around the Jews of Europe, the Ashkenazim, but the pattern repeats itself elsewhere, even in the Middle East.

### Jews as "the foreigners"

Historically, Jews have been seen as "the others", foreigners, that don't belong to the country they reside. Leading them to be seen as a foreign threat. Jews have been used as a scapegoat whenever there has been an internal divide or conflict between the "natives". If there was a conflict, the Jews were said to be to blame for it.

This is the reason for all the negativity and slurs that have prevailed into the 20th century, and even exist today. Being "othered".

Due to the persecution, Jews have throughout history largely kept their interactions with other people at a minimum. That has contributed to them being less open and therefore the lack of understanding about Jewish culture and religion.

Even in the Middle-East this was a thing, although the Jewish presence, in for instance Arabia, predates Islam, and the Arab conquest. The Jews from that area can be seen as native there.

### "Jews are greedy"

Due to them historically being barred from owning property, being limited to being tradesmen and lending money, they got the reputation of being greedy. The fact is that no other people was allowed to handle money because of Christian doctrine about usury. And because of this it instilled in Jews, at least in Europe, a good sense of saving and investing money.

### Misunderstandings about the "Chosen people"

By Anti-semites, the claim that Jews are the "Chosen people" is often used as some kind of claim for Jewish supremacy. 

Jews being the "Chosen people" is about the covenant with God, the ethical mission to heal the world spiritually, and not about any preference by God. It's not that Jews think they are better than others.

Jewish religious tradition is an ethical framework that is not based on blind faith, but on intention, with the Torah is the scripture that is guiding them. The ethical basis is universal, and for all mankind (the Noachide Laws), but Jews have some special commandment to follow: the Mitzvot.

It doesn't rule out that other people have different covenants with God, and therefore are chosen for other reasons. And even Jews are clear about that.

However, the "Chosen people" has been willfully misconstrued by opponents because of the situation between Israel and Palestine. "How can you be the 'Chosen people' when you are killing Palestinians".

### "Jews are controlling the world"

The allegation that Jews control the world seems to stem from a pamphlet that was spread in 1905, called the “Protocols of the Elders of Zion”, originating in Russia. It was written as some kind of acknowledgment by "Zionists" ("Jews") that they were controlling and taking over the world from behind the scenes - "World Zionism". Having supposedly infiltrated liberal, capitalist, communist, and free masonic elites. Since then this has been a common antisemitic conspiracy theory.

It has been shown that the Tzarist Secret Services (of Russia) was behind the spreading of the pamphlet, and even claimed it to be an address delivered at the World Zionist Congress in Basel 1897, by Theodor Herzl himself, the leading person of the World Zionist movement that in fact was aiming for Jewish self-determination by establishing a Jewish homeland.

This further led to establishing "Zionist" as a slur referring to Jew, which carried over to the Soviet Union.

### "Jews are capitalist/communist"

As we have seen, Jews have both been blamed by the left as being capitalist, and the right as being communist. Because of all this historic bagage of antisemitic bigotry they are: Capitalist for supposedly being greedy. Communist for caring about their own kind. And this contradiction was cemented by the "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion". 

Jews wanting to become a part of society and contributing to it has disproved it. There are Jews both on the right, and the left. And there are both intersecting and diverging opinions. Jews are known to disagree with each other, for the most part, respectfully.

### "Jews murdered Jesus"

This one might not be as prevalent in the largely secular "Old World" (Europe):

It has historically been portrayed, by Christians, that Jews collectively had turned on Jesus - and effectively killed him. To further establish the notion of betrayal and otherness - to divorce Christianity from Judaism. But Jesus was a Jew. The Bible says, it was the Romans that sentenced and murdered Jesus because he was seen as a threat.

Whether the events happened, or not, we can discuss another time.

Christian antisemitism is a thing. A leftover from when Christianity tried to replace Judaism. That requires to get deeper into history, but we leave that for now.

### Arab antisemitism

In the Arab world, antisemitism has its source in a mix of religious doctrine and foreign influence.

Since most Palestinians, and indeed Arabs, are muslim they do follow what the Quran, as well as the Sunnah says about Jews. 

The hadith says:

<blockquote>“Judgement Day will not come until the Muslims fight the Jews. The Jews will hide behind the stones and the trees, and the stones and the trees will say, oh Muslim, oh servant of Allah, there is a Jew hiding behind me — come and kill him.”</blockquote>

To this day, islamist and jihadists, use this as a basis for creating Arab Muslim unity against Jews. In the belief that once the Jews have been defeated, then Islam will take over the world.

Many people don't know that both Nazis and the Soviet influenced the Middle-East, spreading both Nazi and Marxist ideas. That is why the Palestinian movement to this day, think fondly about Hitler and his mission to eradicate the Jews. Thinking the Holocaust was a justified measure against the Jews. They Arabs don't say Zionist, but Jews.

Sine the start of war in Gaza, after October 7 2023,  Israeli army (IDF) have found numerous of copies of Hitler's Mein Kampf spread around Gaza.

## What is Anti-Zionism?

### What is a "Zionist"?

The term "Zionist" come from the World Zionism movement, at the end of the 19th century. After the Jewish Emancipation, there was increasing antisemitism in Europe, and Jews sough for Jewish self-determination. Leading to the Jewish nationalist movement, headed by the World Zionist Congress. The term "Zion" is from a name for Jerusalem. As mentioned, the goal was self-determination for the Jewish people, by establishing a Jewish homeland in the "Land of Israel", known as Palestine. A land at that time ruled by the Ottoman Empire, and then by the British Mandate of Palestine.

### "The Evil Zionists"

The use use of "Zionist" as a slur for Jew date back to the early 20th century.

As alluded to before, the term "Zionist" as many anti-semites use it today was established in Russia as a slur for Jew - to mark them as a threat to the country. That was before Israel even existed. It carried little connection to Zionism - more than it connected Jews to "Zionist". It was a way to dehumanize and marginalize Jews as a separate group with their own political motives - when most just wanted to be treated as equals.

In the Soviet Union, they tried to break down ethnic and class divisions, and yet antisemitism still existed there. Despite that, many Jews in the Soviet were socialists but had a different understanding of it that was a threat to the regime.  People were thinking that Jews sought power.

### Contemporary "Anti-Zionism"

Today, Anti-zionism, antisemitism disguised as a legitimate criticism and dislike for Israel. Often referring to the Israel-Palestine conflict, and how badly Israel supposedly treat Palestinians. Likening them to Nazis. While Palestinians themselves have a very bad record in attacking Jews for being... Jews.

Anti-zionism is often used as an excuse to attack Jews for being Jewish. Especially from the anti-colonialist leftist and the Muslim side. Jews are still seen as the catalyst, for being either capitalist that once defeated will bring a new world Socialist order, or an Islamic caliphate.

Due to increasing immigration to Europe from Arab Muslim countries in the Middle-East, antisemitism is an ever increasing threat to the social order.

### "Don't bring your conflict here"

There is an increasing rhetoric that seem to blame Arabs and Jews alike for bringing the Israeli-Palestine conflict to whatever country. Mostly seeming to blame the Jews for it.

Although many Jews have a connection to Israel, having family there, they don't have any part of the conflict.

Assuming that a Jew is a Zionist, and them having part in the conflict is drawing on antisemitic tropes that Jews are this united collective with a shared agenda, or even a shared mind

Jews are humans, as different as any other group of humans.

### When does Antisemitism and Anti-Zionism coincide?

One knows that by being aware of the history of antisemitism, and by being able to read between the lines.

When someone is calling a Jews a small, dirty, and nasty "Zionist" you are immediately evokes antisemitic tropes. And when they accuse a Jews of being without empathy. Or when they mean that Zionist control the world.

If they only accept a Jew being a Zionist and gentiles being useful idiots.

Read between the lines, and discover the historic antisemitic tropes till being spread, but re-packaged to not be as apparent.

In reality, all anti-Zionists are antisemitic.... because none of them consider the rights of the Jewish people.
