## Younger years

I'm the oldest of 4 siblings, each with 2 years between. When I was a young kid I did not get child's play - especially boy's play since it so rouge and about comparing yourself physically. I have a brother who was two years younger than me and we did not get along because of that. I rather spent my time with the adults, especially the women. When my younger siblings often had playmates. I most of the time had none, except for when someone from schools wants to "play" or hang out with you once. To be honest, I don't remember those times and those people. As I said, I would be around my mom, and my aunt, and my grandmother whom I loved so much. They did all fundamentally shape me as a person. I did not really care about gender or so, but I stuck to and related more related to the women. At times I was jealous about my sister, because she came along she got all the attention, and I felt like I was apart from the women. And I did at times imagining turning into a girl. My dad, however, had his convictions about gender roles from early on. Although I sensed that and adapted to it, I did not realize the extent until much later in my life. How much fear of social expectations have haunted me.

Thinking back on how I experienced emotions as a kid, I was always very self-centered and reactionary. I reacted strongly to things and situations that made me uncomfortable. Not like the typical boy. That made stand out in the developmental curve. I was not the way that my dad expected me to be - his perception of how a child should behave. Him and I had frequent meltdowns together because I sensed "something was wrong". And we both needed our own space. I am still to this day very receptive to emotional contagion - this affect how I handle stressful situations.

My favorite pass-time as a kid and in my early adolescence was drawing. I drew houses and portraits, and later "inventions". In that period in my life I alway carried some paper to draw on. It was my way of making sense of the world and to express myself. My mom enrolled med into a drawing class, but I admit that I would rather draw the things that I wanted. And of course, me and my siblings spent and awful lot of time building LEGO. Around the time of my 5 year, I got introduced to computers by my dad. So I started spending most of my time exploring the virtual space - and as you may get, computing is still a big part of my life to this day. But I remember spending a lot of time with MS Paint and then games where you build stuff. I have never been heavy into computer games, but I really enjoyed Roller Coaster Tycoon. Just because you create your own little world. Creativity has always been in my veins. My mom is a creative person who likes to sew, knit and do crochet, and she involved us in making crafts at an early age. She also enjoys doing cooking.

### School

At school, I used to be at my own, as and independent, but with other people in the hallway - not in a clique. When others went on recess I was drawing to pass the time. At one point I enjoyed practicing handwriting and doing cursives. I still get a lot of praise for my handwriting sometimes. To me it was a way to escape the distress of not fitting in socially - for not understanding social interactions. 

It was at this time they noticed that there was something special about me. At first they noticed that I was inattentive to regular forms of teaching and methods. My interaction with others appeared unilateral. When talking about something I would in effect control the conversation - making myself the center of it. It was more about me finding out stuff from someone else, usually from an adult. It was not that I wanted to be rude, I was simply not aware how it was perceived by others. This was before Internet was a widespread phenomenon, but I would now call it the "Wikipedia syndrome" with an autistic touch.

I initially got the now defunct diagnosis DAMP (Deficits in Attention, Motor control and Perception) which shared a lot of traits with ADHD/ADD. Incidentally, the word "Damp" was used by the kids for name-calling a person who frequently loosed their temper. I am proud that I defended myself and my diagnosis though. Even when someone called me other stuff, like "faggot", I was quick to do the right thing and tell them. I already had a strong moral sense back then.

This also played in how I interacted with my peers. I did not feel the same sense of belonging with them. The interactions that I had with them were mostly interest-based. Because I did not get the "social game" that kids play, I had no perception of dishonesty or teasing for social gain. That made me vulnerable when kids, as some do, tease you in the playground, or trick you of your Pokémon cards. I did not understand this behavior, I do not think that they, the other kids, did either. I assumed that these, from a child's view, stereotypically bad things that these kids did to others simply was an outlet for their own insecurities.

Back then cartoons on TV did help me a lot in gaining some understanding of being a kid, and I inferred the nuances from that.

At 12, I was finally diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome - a diagnosis on the Autism spectrum. I did not want to recognize that diagnosis because I just wanted to be normal. So I knew very little about it, about myself. While I had support in school, I came to explore the world my way. 

And to get the social stimulation that I couldn't get from, I was paired up with an older guy (9 years older than me), who at that time was an assistant for my youngest bother at school. We hung out, went swimming, golfing, went to the cinema, riding in his car. I was very difficult for him at first, I didn't want to do anything that he proposed. It shows how I was at that stage in my life - I would rather stay at home in front of my computer. Since he was into cars we sometimes did stuff around that. He made me feel as part of his gang of friends. The guy introduced me to things my mom did not like, because he thought it was good for me. It was with him that later got introduced to alcohol. I drank Vodka and Coke for the first time with him and his friend. I had previously been a good boy and been against alcohol. He also showed me adult films, that I don't find that interesting.

## Early teenage years

Being a teenager was hard for me. While my peers socialized and experienced the joys and sadness of friendship and heartbreaks, I was the odd one out not getting it. I was observing them exploring how to be adults, them being rebellious teenage-y way. Never got invited into the popular circles, and in hindsight, that was probably something good. Some of my peers did tease me and so, but I had a very easy time shaking it off and move on since I was not socially aware. I was lucky that I had adults to go to for support and advice.

I was grouped with the geeky kids, with whom I did exchange my interest in Pokémon and such. But they were a little more into the gaming thing than I was. So I kept to computers and looking up stuff that interested me on the Internet. You don't not know much of the school's paper I consumed on printing Wikipedia pages. That was the only way to access it outside school. It was right before cheap high-speed Internet at home became a I thing - Long before having smartphones and "knowledge at your fingertips". In middle-school, I was first instructed by teachers in special education outside my normal class. That did affect my sense of not being like others. But later I joined normal classes. 

My perspective on my peers was like that of an alien observing the human species and drawing conclusions from their own experiences. I did not understand social interaction because I had barely started to see what others might think an feel of me - I was living in my own bubble. When others got interested in sexual interactions I lacked that essential part of getting along with people. My interactions with other people were mostly interest-based, and I did not share interest with the people that I wished to be with.

When it comes to puberty, I did not really mind the changes. I started got slimmer and more like the rest of the boys. As I said, I did not have the typical experience in exploring my identity in relation to other people. Occasionally, the popular and sporty kids in my class teased me for being odd or showing interest in this or that girl that clearly was not interested. This is all typical kids/teenager behavior but I did not get it.

How I still viewed boys and girls was quite superficial - like a child does. I was scared of coming of as "feminine" or so. Afterwards I recognize that being a certain type of person was role that someone else assigned to me and that I struggled so hard to fit into. I was open-minded, but yet so driven by social expectations and stereotypes. Crossdressing caught my attention. But since I was all about fitting into what is expected and be being normal, I never pursued that or talked about that with anyone. I could not even explain my own sexuality.

Alcohol was introduced in a safe way with some older guys.

Looking back, this period did pave the ground for my identity and outlook on life.

At about 17, I realized that I look a certain way and I have certain expectations on me. I will always be treated a certain way by people because of that. Sex, gender and what not. So I have to live the role.

### My interests in foreign languages and stuff

I eventually enrolled in Spanish language class which I enjoyed very much. My interest for languages and culture had already been there. I had already been learning German for a couple of years, although I had not been able to get fluent because of lack of interactions. It was with music that I then explored the languages further by translating the lyrics to find their inner meaning - decoding grammatical structures and idioms. It is with music we explore emotions and what it means to be human. I listened to bands and artist such as Rammstein, Shakira, and a whole host of other artists from other countries that were not that known internationally. 

Having this interest in foreign stuff became a very personal experience for me. I was imagining me in another social settings that I would rather fit in. I never really spoke that much about that interest back then, because I thought it was so odd to have that interest when most of the foreign culture influence and music was centered around the English language. And don't get me wrong, I did listen to English music as well. I just did not find it that special and appealing to me at that time. 

My interest for foreign culture and music is still with me today.

## My time in upper secondary school

Then it was time to 

I moved to a school were I was one of few people from my old school, indeed few from from my home municipality.

This was also the time when I started to feel strong sexual attraction, the one that makes you crazy and unstable. Teenage depression. The social pressure to have a girlfriend. To be honest it was emotional and a young person can not always.

I was still sometimes hanging out with the guy that I mentioned before.

The third year I was mostly on my own. I went to Spain for 6 weeks that autumn.
