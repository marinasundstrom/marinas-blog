Back in 2019, I was working as a consultant, doing an assignment at a big company. I was approaching my 30s and my life had been in crisis for about a year already. 

## The Identity crisis

It started with sad things happening to members of my family which affected my identity. Then my beloved grandmother died suffering from Alzheimer's. A long process that I until then had suppressed.

By this time, I had begun to ask what I really wanted to do with my life - what would make me happy? Do I really want to be stationed alone out at companies? I felt like an unempowered outsider without connection. I felt the impostor syndrome. What about my opportunities to grow? It did not seem that my employer, the consultancy company, could give me those opportunities and the stimulation that I so desperately needed. 

I also wanted to be what I thought as more genuine about myself with other people - to be more honest about myself and my opinions. And I was thinking back on my past when I had a better social life. My mental health did affect me and my outlook at that time. 

### The assignment and how it was affected

The work ran mostly smooth. Perhaps a blur.

At that time I was so stressed that I was hypersensitive, I could not focus outside the bubble that I created with music in my headset. I had problems with "Big room plannings" since I could not stand the noise. The manager, she did not like that. I did not dare to tell her how I really felt. In fact, I was not that aware at all myself.

Whenever it was possible, I sought distraction in stuff that I liked. Taking walks, drawing, and working my own projects. That also helped me focus.

There was a bit of a rivalry with the team abroad, who always wanted to proceed fast, come with ideas, and work on the cool new stuff. I pushed myself a bit hard when I wanted to show that I also had ideas. Not that I did not get any ideas through.

I then realized the reality of being a consultant: You are just different from the employees. That triggered the next phase of the crisis for me.

## Getting a new assignment

When the assignment ended, after 1 year, I was “on the bench” again looking for a new assignment. While at my company’s office, I started to view it all a bit critically. I found this environment familiar but mundane. It was not like I was truly a part of it. My relationship with my then-manager went back 3 years at my old employer. To me he was a nice person but I never felt that I could be truly myself around him.

The pressure came to find a new assignment. You believe that I was not very keen.

Me and some other consultants where introduced to a man who had approached the consultancy company about doing some work for him. We had our individual interviews with the man and he was impressed with me. He excitingly told me that I was an underused resource. The other consultants had declined because they did not believe in what he wanted them to get done. Apparently, they had got another impression of him. It was not even entirely clear what the scope was at the time, but he had a plan.

My manager insisted that I should take the assignment to get some experience to put on my CV/Resumé. I felt obligated and did not refuse.

I remember my first day coming to the man's room in an office hotel. I was 15 minutes late and he got very angry because of that. He was being very strict, telling me to carefully write down his instructions on paper. The day after he presumably went on a business trip.

## End note

In hindsight, I think that many of the people that I frequented during that period also had their own doubts and life crises. And they did everything they could to shield themselves.
